Once upon a time, in a restaurant 3 miles down the road, lonely old man ordered a quarter triple deluxe with all the mayo they had, with a side of hash brown patties (the McDonald's ones). It turned out that the restaurant the old man had went to wasn't a McDonald's at all, and so they couldn't provide the McDonald's hashbrowns, or all the mayo they had.
